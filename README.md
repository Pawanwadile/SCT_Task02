🕒 Stopwatch Web Application


---

📄 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of my Web Development Internship (Task 2) with SkillCraft Technology.
The main goal of this task was to design and implement a functional Stopwatch Web Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The stopwatch allows users to start, stop, reset, and record lap times.
It demonstrates DOM manipulation, event handling, and real-time updates using JavaScript — core skills essential for front-end web development.
